## Flowchart Sirius diagram specification

Building on the flowchart meta-model provided, complete the odesign file (in project `uk.ac.kcl.inf.mdd7b.flowchart.design`) specifying a diagram and node and edge mappings for all non-abstract elements in the meta-model. You can test your growing design directly by opening a diagram for a new flowcharts model and editing the contents of the model in the tree editor.

Hint: To make this work, you may have to first open the metamodel diagram and select `Generate`>`All` from the context menu.

Eventually, commit your code and auto-grading should go through and give you 30/30 points.
